## 📱 Step 5: Update Netlify Sites with Backend URL

### 5.1 After Railway Deployment

1. **Copy your Railway app URL** (e.g., `https://autoaniv-production.up.railway.app`)
2. **Go to each Netlify site** → Site settings → Environment variables
3. **Update**:

   ```
   VITE_API_URL=https://autoaniv-production.up.railway.app/api
   VITE_UPLOAD_URL=https://autoaniv-production.up.railway.app/uploads
   ```

4. **Redeploy both sites** (Trigger deploy in Netlify)
